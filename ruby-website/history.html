    <h1>History of Ruby</h1>
    <span class=bold>Origin:</span><br />
    <p>Matsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. The name "Ruby" originated 
        during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, 
        before any code had been written for the language. The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was 
        announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995. Subsequently, three 
        more versions of Ruby were released in two days. Ruby is designed for programmer productivity 
        and fun, following the principles of good user interface design.
