    <h1>Features of Ruby</h1>
    <img src="C:\Users\Max-Student\Desktop\img\matsumoto.jpg"><br />
    <span>Creator:</span><br />
    <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto</p>
    <span>Purpose:</span><br />
    <p>Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, 
        following the principles of good user interface design. At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 
        Matsumoto further stated, "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, 
        and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language." 
        He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs.</p>
    <span>Style:</span><br />
    <p>Ruby is said to follow the principle of least astonishment (POLA), meaning that the 
        language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Ruby is 
        object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many 
        other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and "null").
